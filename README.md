Use HTML5 tags only.

Make the webpage responsive. 

Webpage should have a lazy load on the images.

Use Owl Carousel for the sliders.

Webpage should work properly on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge).

Use dummy images & dummy content wherever required.

Use pure JavaScript or jQuery for building the menu for mobile resolution.

The webpage should have a page loader that covers the entire screen and should fade after the page is loaded.
